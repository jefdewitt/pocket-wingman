# pocket-wingman
This repo contains my first mobile app -- Pocket Wingman for iOS.

It's built following an MVC framework but as it is my first experience with this design pattern there's a little 
bleed over from functionality to modeling to views. This app was created to break the ice with people by engaging 
them with games utilizing the functionality/hardware of an iPhone.
