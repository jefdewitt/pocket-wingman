# pocket-wingman

Pocket Wingman is a conversation starter. It's also an iOS app written in Objective-C. Using iPhone's touch screen, accelerometer, and some cute software logic, Pocket Wingman breaks the ice for you. All you need to do is open the app and pass it to someone to get the conversation started. 

To get a copy of the app just visit [Pocket Wingman]() at the App Store.

# Requirements

- Xcode 6+

# Installation

Download [Xcode](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12) from the App Store.

## Details

Pocket Wingman is an SPA with three distinct views. Admittedly, she's my first software baby and I made a few mistakes in bringing her to life. For one, I butchered the MVC design paradigm, mixing controllers and views into single files. Field tests have also revealed some areas that need improvement.

## TODO

- Separate views from controllers
- Increase touch target size
- Place all model data into its own file
